# RayTracer

## Ojashvi Rautela and Kiet Tran

Implementing a ray tracer from scratch.

# Build and run the code

## Windows

1. Download and open [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html "Cygwin's Download Page"). 

2. From Cygwin, run the same commands for Mac and Linux (described in the section right after this one).

3. Instead of running the command `./raytracer`, you can double click on `raytracer.exe` in the `RayTracer/src` folder to run the program.

## Mac and Linux

Open Terminal and run the following commands: 

```
cd your/code/directory
git clone https://github.com/ojashvirautela/RayTracer.git
cd RayTracer/src
make
./raytracer
```
